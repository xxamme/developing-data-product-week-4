## Coursera Reproducible Pitch
### See the Regression Models Course Project  

- URL: *https://github.com/xxamme/developing-data-product-week-4*
- Find here all the data that have been use for this presentation and also for the first part of the data Science Project: "First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application."

## mtcars dataset

### Motor Trend Car Road Tests

> The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

## Analysis - main code

```r
  formulaTextPoint <- reactive({
    paste("mpg ~", "as.integer(", input$variable, ")")  })
  
  fit <- reactive({
    lm(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()), data=mpgData)  })
  ...
  output$fit <- renderPrint({
    summary(fit()) })
  
  output$mpgPlot <- renderPlot({
    with(mpgData, {
      plot(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()))
      abline(fit(), col=2)
    })  })
```
